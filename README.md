# Number Comparison Program

This C# console application allows the user to input two integer numbers and compare them. If the first input is greater than the second, the program will output "A is bigger than B". If the first input is smaller than the second, the program will output "numberA is smaller than numberB". If the two inputs are equal, the program will output "numberA is equal to numberB". The program will continue to prompt the user for input until the user enters "quit" or valid integer values.

## Requirements

To run this program, you will need to have [.NET Core](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) installed on your machine.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine or download the source code as a zip file and extract it to a directory of your choice.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the code is located.

## Usage

1. When the program starts, it will prompt the user to enter "Y" to begin or "N" to end the program.
2. If the user enters "Y", the program will prompt the user to input two integer values, numberA and numberB.
3. The user can input valid integer values for numberA and numberB or enter "quit" to exit the program.
4. The program will compare the two inputs and output the result. If the input is invalid, the program will display an error message and prompt the user to enter valid integer values.
5. The program will repeat steps 2-4 until the user enters "quit" or ends the program by entering "N".
